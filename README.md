# BendTableIssueDemo
This program is to demostrate that the DVDeriveBendDirectionFromView setting in the api does not have the same effect as the  "Derive Bend Direction From View" setting in the Options dialog.
Setting this setting through the api does not affect the setting on the Options file dialog as can be seen by using "Spy for Solid Edge".
